siege_tools
===========

This is a repo where I plan to store any handy tools I come up with for working with siege. I've had to do that a lot recently, and one of the things that I've had problems with is that the normal output from someone else running siege is the output file cribbed from stdout. Because of that I've taken some time to come up with code for taking that output and putting it into a more manipulable format - taking the opportunity to learn some tricks along the way.
